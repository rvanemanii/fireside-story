    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
	<p>As I lay in bed, I heard a small scratching noise from downstairs.</p>
	<p>On the way down the stairs, I saw a pumpkin rolling through the 
	opened front door...</p>
	<p>On closer inspection, I noticed the eyes carved into the pumpkin 
	looked just like my wifes' blue eyes!</p>
	<p>I looked up just in time to see a headless rider mounted on a 
	black horse...</p>
